          <div class="invite_form_head">What is Juristerra?</div>
            <p>Juristerra is a web platform built to help attorneys share, connect, and collaborate. Attorneys can publish and review legal materials and industry news, connect with each other to view detailed work history, and use these materials to find partners and co-counsel for their practices.</p>
            <div class="invite_form_head">What is the purpose of Juristerra?</div>
            <p>Juristerra is a network built for the legal community where attorneys can share and demonstrate their abilities with each other. Our purpose is to build the community with specific technology offerings that can make these transactions easier and aid attorneys in cooperating with each other. We offer features that aid in collaboration and intend to add additinal offerings that help facilitate this further.</p>
            <div class="invite_form_head">When was Juristerra founded?</div>
            <p>Juristerra was founded in early 2015 and we have been working on it ever since!</p>
            <div class="invite_form_head">Who is the intended audience/user base of Juristerra?</div>
            <p>Juristerra is built first and foremost for attorneys. Through discussions and research (and our own personal backgrounds), we noticed the amount of lost time spent by attorneys trying to collaborate with their colleagues, specially on sharing materiasl, discussion of those material, and keeping clients up to date. Additionally, hiring co-counsel or consultants became a chore. We are here to help with all of that! By creating a unified site for collaboration and connection, our goal is to empower our attorney members to work directly and with greater speed with their colleagues and clients.</p>
            <div class="invite_form_head">Is Juristerra only for attorneys?</div>
            <p>Juristerra is currently built for attorneys. We are working hard on expanding our offerings and plan to open the platform for support staff as well (ex. paralegals). Clients of attorneys or those seeking legal representation or consultation may join as well.</p>
            <div class="invite_form_head">Who has the ability to see my profile and/or personal information?</div>
            <p>Profile views are limited to members of Juristerra. Non members cannot see your profile. Client members are separate and not available for all to see. If you do have the specific address or URL of someone's profile, you may use it. Privacy settings that allow for more specific access are currently under development and will be released in following versions.</p>
            <div class="invite_form_head">Does Juristerra cost money? Are there plans available?</div>
            <p>Juristerra is currently a free platform. Our goal is to help attorneys utilize their network effectively and assist in making a better online legal community. We do have great features in store and will introduce paid plans in addition to our free plan to support them. Members can switch between these paid and free plans through their settings pages.</p>
            <div class="invite_form_head">How do you calculate recommendations of an attorney?</div>
            <p>Recommendations for attorneys are provided by members of Juristerra. Attorneys, clients, and other members add their "recommendations" in the various fields in the profile page or elsewhere on the website. The aggregate recommendations recevied by an attorneys on their profile and/or for their contributions such as articles published or blogs written and shared will determine the overall recommendation score of that attorney.</p>
