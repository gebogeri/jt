    							<p class="faq_text">Juristerra is built first and foremost for attorneys. Through discussions and research (and our own personal backgrounds), we noticed the amount of lost time spent by attorneys trying to collaborate with their colleagues, specially on sharing materiasl, discussion of those material, and keeping clients up to date. Additionally, hiring co-counsel or consultants became a chore. We are here to help with all of that! By creating a unified site for collaboration and connection, our goal is to empower our attorney members to work directly and with greater speed with their colleagues and clients.
